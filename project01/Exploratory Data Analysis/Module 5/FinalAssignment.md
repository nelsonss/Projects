# Introduction to the Final Assignment
Help Wanted! Data Scientist Needed to Assist Prioritizing Resources
Throughout this course, you’ve used the storm event files to practice exploring and analyzing data. For the final assignment you’ve been hired to help an insurance company decide where to outside contractors to assist claims adjusters in the aftermath of a large-scale weather event.

When major weather events occur, insurance companies often hire outside contractors to assist the claims adjusters due to the large, temporary increase in claims. You are tasked with helping the insurance company decide where to send the contractors in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. You need to explore and analyze the 2017 storm event data, create a report, and provide recommendations to management (your peer-reviewers) regarding where to send the contractors to.

To do this, you will use “StormEvents_2017_finalProject.csv.” This data set differs from others used so far as it includes a new variable “CZ_Name” which is the name of the county the event was reported. Counties are smaller sub-regions of states and the insurance company wants to know which counties should be prioritized. Counties are unique within a state, but different states may have counties with the same name. Both California and Florida have an Orange County, for example.

While in a real-world example, actual property damage would be unknown, for purposes of this exercise assume the Property_Cost variable reflects estimates from models based on property the company insures and the percent of the market they capture.

## Hurricane Harvey 
In 2017, Hurricane Harvey became one of the costliest hurricanes on record, causing approximately $125 billion in damage. Most of the damage was caused from flooding with some areas receiving over 40 inches (102 cm) of rain.

Hurricanes are large weather events with a specific definition – a rotating low-pressure weather system with sustained winds of 74+ mph (119 km/h). Harvey became a hurricane August 24th, made landfall on the 25th, and was downgraded to a tropical storm on August 26th.

The impact of Harvey was felt over much more than just 3 days. In the 2017 storm events data set, Harvey related events are reported beginning August 17th and end September 3rd as the system moved north and east across the United States. Flooding, thunderstorms, hail, and tornadoes are just a few of the weather events related to Harvey. 

One of your tasks as the hired data scientist is to find the two states with the most damage from Harvey related events.  

## States Impacted and Dates of the Weather System
As a data scientist, it is important to gather data from multiple sources and learn about the event. Context can often help you determine if your results are reasonable. For this assignment, we provide you with some context to help you find Harvey related events.

You may focus on the following states impacted by Harvey: 

Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.

You can also assume that Harvey related events occurred only from the 17th of August to the 3rd of September. 

## Communicate Your Results
Use formatted text and headings to help highlight key results while you work through the project.

As you work on the assignment, keep in mind that the target audience of an analysis is often not other data scientists! In this scenario, the insurance company needs to decide where to send outside contractors to help file claims. This will have a big impact on many decisions, such as airports, hotels, and other transportation. Before committing to a course of action, management will want to see the information that leads to your recommendation.

Here, peers from a wide variety of backgrounds will be reviewing your work. You will not be assessed on any written work. However, effectively communicating your steps will help your peers better follow your work and find key information in your analysis.

## Need Inspiration?
NOAA creates reports for major weather events to present the atmospheric conditions leading to the event and the impact on the population. The link below points to the NOAA report for Hurricane Harvey published in January of 2018 (updated in May of 2018). The report contains nine tables and twenty-two figures. You do not need to include much detail in your report. This is a nice example of using Exploratory Data Analysis and multiple data sources to answer the question “What Happened?”
