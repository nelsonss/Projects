# Covid-19 Data Analysis Challenge
Good work reaching the end of this project.
You're now able to calculate group statistics and visualize the results.
You can also filter data to focus on the observations of interest.
With these skills, you can recreate much of the analysis you've seen reported in the media regarding the spread of Covid-19.
Test your new skills by going to the Resources section and viewing the MATLAB Covid-19 Data Analysis Challenge. There, you'll find instructions on how to access Covid-19 data and get started exploring the data. Submit your analysis for a chance to have your report highlighted in the course! Good luck.
