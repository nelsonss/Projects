# Covid-19 Data Analysis Challenge
Good work reaching the end of this project.
You're now able to calculate group statistics and visualize the results.
You can also filter data to focus on the observations of interest.
With these skills, you can recreate much of the analysis you've seen reported in the media regarding the spread of Covid-19.
Test your new skills by going to the Resources section and viewing the MATLAB Covid-19 Data Analysis Challenge. There, you'll find instructions on how to access Covid-19 data and get started exploring the data. Submit your analysis for a chance to have your report highlighted in the course! Good luck.

Welcome to the MATLAB COVID-19 Data Analysis Challenge. This challenge is an opportunity to use the skills you’ve learned to analyze real-world data.  Even if you’ve only completed a few weeks of the first course, you already have the foundational skills to participate.    

Here’s what to do: 

1. Download and unzip the live script containing instructions and code to help you get started.

2. Watch the introductory video(https://youtu.be/nfAzUqpGpug). The video will guide you through setting up a MATLAB project to access the most up-to-date COVID-19 data.

3. Perform your analysis and email your final report as a PDF to matlab-challenge@groups.mathworks.com

4. Share your reports with your social networks. Make sure to tag us @MATLAB @MathWorks #MATLAB #MathWorks. 

You can also share your results with your classmates by posting it to the discussion forums. We've pinned a forum thread where you can share your results and see the work of others.

Be creative! We will choose exceptional reports to highlight in our courses.  We look forward to seeing your analysis.
